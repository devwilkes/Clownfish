# Clownfish
A Discord bot that adds a ton of fun social functionality to your Discord server. 

Originally an entry for Technica 2023, this quickly turned into a fun personal project since I've never used Discord developer APIs before. I was also taking a Python course at the time, and wanted to use my skills to branch out and work with new projects with my new skills.

The bot will be able to be downloaded from a website that's currently a work-in-progress  alongside the actual bot.
